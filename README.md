# WPDeploy #

### Welcome to our GitHub Repository ###

WPDeploy is a simple sript to deploy WordPress development sites on the fly. It makes a few assumptions, and therefore may not be suitable for all (or even most) users, but hopefully it helps someone!

## Installation ##

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone git@github.com:Section214/WPDeploy.git`
2. Or download a ZIP file directly: `https://github.com/Section214/WPDeploy/archive/master.zip`

Either method will download the latest version of WPDeploy. Once you have it, you will want to put the wpdeploy file somewhere in your `$PATH` and make it executable.

## Usage ##

* Just run `wpdeploy --help`... it's easier that way.
